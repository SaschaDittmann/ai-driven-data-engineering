# Prompt: Implement the dbt Transformation Models

Copy the prompt below into your AI coding assistant.

~~~
Use skill: implement-tasks

Read the tasks in docs/tasks/ and implement all transformation-related tasks (everything related to dbt, staging models, and marts). Build a dbt project that transforms the raw data in DuckDB into clean staging models and analytical marts. Do not work on the ingestion/dlt tasks — those were completed in Lab 1.

KEY REQUIREMENTS

- Location: All dbt code in transform/ directory
- Database: DuckDB at data/pokedex.db
- Adapter: Use dbt-duckdb
- Source data: Raw tables created by dlt in Lab 1

MODEL SPECIFICATIONS

Staging Layer (1:1 mapping of raw tables):
- Rename columns to snake_case
- Cast data types explicitly
- Select only relevant columns
- Add _loaded_at timestamp from dlt metadata if available

Mart Models:

1. fct_pokemon_stats — Each Pokemon's base stats with:
   - Individual stats as columns (hp, attack, defense, sp_attack, sp_defense, speed)
   - Calculated BST (Base Stat Total = sum of all stats)
   - Comparison against the average of its primary type (e.g., "Is this Pikachu faster than the average Electric-type?")

2. dim_type_effectiveness — Type matchup matrix:
   - Columns: attacking_type, defending_type, damage_multiplier
   - Values: 2.0 (super effective), 1.0 (normal), 0.5 (not very effective), 0.0 (immune)

3. fct_competitive_moves — Move analysis with:
   - Pokemon name, move name, move type, power, accuracy, damage class
   - STAB flag: true when the move's type matches one of the Pokemon's types
   - STAB power: if STAB is true, power * 1.5

TESTING

- Define dbt tests in schema.yml files:
  - unique + not_null on primary keys
  - accepted_values on type columns
  - relationships between marts and staging models
- Create end-to-end tests in tests/ (pytest) that verify dbt models have data

## While the AI Works

Observe how it handles:
- Setting up the dbt-duckdb connection (`profiles.yml`)
- Discovering the raw table names created by dlt
- Writing complex SQL (window functions for type-average comparisons, STAB logic)
